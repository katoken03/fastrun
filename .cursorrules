Project: f - Command Launcher
Description: A command launcher tool that helps developers run npm scripts and make targets without remembering exact command names.

Technical Stack:
- Language: Go
- Key Dependencies:
  - github.com/spf13/cobra for CLI
  - github.com/tidwall/gjson for JSON parsing
  - External dependency on fzf command for fuzzy finding

Project Structure:
/cmd             - Command-line interface
/internal
  /config        - Configuration handling
  /runner        - Command runner interface and types
  /ui           - User interface (fzf integration)
/plugins         - Command runners for different build tools
  /npm          - NPM scripts handler
  /make         - Makefile handler

Configuration:
- Global: ~/.config/f/config.json
- Project-specific: .f/config.json
- Supports comments in JSON configuration files

Design Principles:
1. Plugin-based architecture for easy extension
2. Simple and intuitive interface
3. Minimal dependencies
4. Configuration precedence: project > global > defaults

Code Style:
- Follow standard Go conventions
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for non-obvious logic
- Error handling should be explicit and informative

Future Extensions:
- Support for Laravel
- Support for Ruby on Rails
- Support for other build tools via plugins
